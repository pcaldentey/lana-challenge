This code is done in python 3.6

## Approach

We need to build a server to communicate with over the network. And a client. We will build a REST API with all the four endpoints we need, and a class and a script that handles it as client.

In order to build REST API server I will use FastAPi framework and the docker image that fastAPI give us to play with.

## Tools & libraries
