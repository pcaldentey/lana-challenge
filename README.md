# Lana challenge

[Problem description](https://gist.github.com/samlown/17abc235580fb291dd153b9c45e441d0)

## Approach
**Talk about why python!!**

So we need to build a server to communicate with over the network. And a client. We will build a REST API with all the four endpoints we need, and a class and a script that handles it as a client.

In order to build REST API server I will use FastAPi framework and the docker image that fastAPI give us to play with.

## Tools & libraries
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
